This is a deep learning project on motionSense dataset that its goal is to detect type of activity based on data that it gets from the sensor.

# **About MotionSense Dataset**

It's a great and complete dataset that includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected with an iPhone 6s kept in the participant's front pocket using SensingKit which collects information from Core Motion framework on iOS devices. All data collected in 50Hz sample rate. A total of 24 participants in a range of gender, age, weight, and height performed 6 activities in 15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking, jogging, sitting, and standing. With this dataset, we aim to look for personal attributes fingerprints in time-series of sensor data, i.e. attribute-specific patterns that can be used to infer gender or personality of the data subjects in addition to their activities.

# **Dimension Reduction**
In this part I wanted to plot the data in 2D so I used T-SNE and PCA for this purpose. As you can see the results, they're really the same. I guess it's because of the distribution of data that a mathematical technique like pca and probabilistic one like tsne have given the same results.
